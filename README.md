Overview:
•	The circuit will receive an an audio signal from a 3.5mm jack that is connected to a computer or some other mobile device. 
•	Afterword's the music will be separated into 7 frequency bands. The volume of each band will be displayed on an LED Decibel meter.
Detailed Summary:
•	Separate’s audio signal into the 7 music frequency bands; Sub-Bass, Bass, Low-Midrange, Midrange, Upper-Midrange, Presence and Brilliance by using 6th order active Butterworth (i.e. Sallen-Key topology) bandpass filters
•	Volume for each frequency band will be represented using 10 LED’s on a logarithmic scale
•	LED’s will be driven with the LM3915 IC which will allow for the LED brightness and volume level comparison to be tunable
•	All sub-circuits are built and tested in LTspice
•	The PCB for the circuit will be designed using KiCad
